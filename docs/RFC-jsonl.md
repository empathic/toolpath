# RFC: JSONL Streaming Format for Toolpath

**Status:** Draft
**Authors:** Eliot Hedeman <eliot.d.hedeman@gmail.com>, Alex Kesling <alex@empathic.dev>

**Extends:** [RFC: Toolpath - A Format for Artifact Transformation Provenance](../RFC.md)

## Abstract

This RFC defines a line-oriented JSONL format as a peer to Toolpath's canonical
JSON format, optimized for incremental persistence of `Path` documents. The
format expresses a `Path` as a stream of self-describing lines — each an
instruction that contributes to the final document — so that writers can append
one complete step at a time rather than buffering the entire path before
serializing.

Any canonical JSON `Path` can be written as JSONL and read back to an
identical document. The reverse direction is lossy — reading collapses
intermediate metadata updates — but the canonical form is stable across
conversion cycles. Signatures computed over canonical JSON remain valid
after any number of JSON → JSONL → JSON conversions.

One additive schema change is required: an optional `graph_ref` field on
`PathIdentity` so a streamed path can name the graph it belongs to up front.

## Motivation

### The Problem

The canonical Toolpath format serializes a `Path` as a single JSON document.
Producers must buffer the entire path before emitting a valid document. This
is a poor fit for live agent traces: a single writer (e.g., Claude Code)
records steps as it works, and a consumer tails the file to display
progress. With the canonical format the writer must either defer writing
until the session completes, or repeatedly rewrite a growing JSON blob —
neither of which supports a readable tailed file.

The streaming format provides an append-only, line-oriented file where
each line is a self-describing unit that incrementally constructs a `Path`
document.

### Goals

1. **Append-only writes.** Writers emit complete lines; no line ever needs
   to be rewritten or removed.
2. **Peer format with canonical JSON.** JSON → JSONL → JSON is lossless;
   the canonical form is stable across conversion cycles.
3. **Complete expressive power.** Every field reachable in canonical JSON is
   reachable through the line set.
4. **Signature preservation.** Signatures computed over canonical JSON
   survive any number of JSON → JSONL → JSON conversion cycles.
5. **Strict, unambiguous parsing.** Malformed input is a fatal error. No
   recovery heuristics.

### Non-Goals

1. **Streaming individual steps.** Each step is atomic per line. Partial
   step construction (e.g., emitting a step identity now and its diff
   later) is out of scope.
2. **Multi-path streams.** A JSONL file encodes exactly one inline `Path`,
   which is wrapped at the file boundary as a single-path `Graph`. Multi-path
   graphs compose JSONL files via existing `$ref` semantics.
3. **Mid-file resync or corruption recovery.** Readers always start from
   line 1.
4. **Transport semantics.** The format is equally usable as a storage
   format, a tailed log, or a transport payload, but no transport is
   specified.

## Scope

v1 covers a single inline `Path` streamed across many JSON lines. The format
is a single-path graph at the file boundary: when readers seal the stream,
they wrap the resulting `Path` as a single-path `Graph` (a `Graph` whose
`paths` array holds exactly one inline path). Multi-path graphs are not
streamable — they live as canonical `.path.json` files and reference
streaming siblings via `$ref`.

## File Extensions

Toolpath documents use a two-part extension that encodes both the
serialization strategy and the streaming variant:

| Extension | Format | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `.path.json` | Canonical JSON | A `Graph` document serialized as a single JSON blob. Multi-path graphs require this format. |
| `.path.jsonl` | Streaming JSONL | A single inline `Path` expressed as a sequence of self-describing JSON lines, sealed as a single-path `Graph` at the file boundary. |

Tools that accept `.path.jsonl` input read it into the same in-memory `Graph`
representation as a `.path.json` file.

Graph `$ref` entries MUST point to sealed `.path.json` files, not to
`.path.jsonl` streams. A `$ref` is a promise that the target is a complete,
valid document; a streaming file may be incomplete or mid-write.
Tools that consume `.path.jsonl` files should convert them to
`.path.json` before incorporating them into a multi-path graph.

## File Structure

### Encoding

| Property | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| Extension | `.path.jsonl` |
| Encoding | UTF-8 |
| Line terminator | LF (`\n`) |
| Line format | One JSON object per line |

No blank lines, no comments, no trailing commas. Each line is a single
externally tagged JSON object:

```
{"<Variant>": <body>}
```

Valid variants: `PathOpen`, `Step`, `ActorDef`, `Signature`, `PathMeta`,
`Head`, `PathClose`.

### Order Constraints

| Constraint | |
| ---------- | --- |
| `PathOpen` | Exactly once, as line 1. |
| `PathClose` | At most once, as the last line (if present). |
| `Head` | Zero or more; last occurrence wins. |
| `Step`, `ActorDef`, `Signature`, `PathMeta` | Zero or more, any order, between `PathOpen` and `PathClose`. |
| `Signature` with `target: "step:<id>"` | Must appear after the referenced `Step` line. |

### Parsing Strictness

Readers MUST treat the following as fatal errors:

- First line is not a valid `PathOpen`.
- Malformed JSON on any line.
- `Signature` targeting a step that has not yet appeared.
- Ambiguous head at EOF when no `Head` line was emitted (see *Reading JSONL*).

Readers SHOULD warn on, but MUST skip, the following:

- Unknown variant at the top level of a line.
- Unknown `version` value in `PathOpen`.

Unknown lines are preserved in memory when possible (implementations
MAY store them as opaque JSON) so that a JSON → JSONL → JSON round-trip
through a newer-format file does not silently discard data. However,
readers are not required to interpret unknown lines, and unknown lines
do not affect the canonical `Path` produced by reading.

This approach favors forward compatibility: a file written by a newer
producer remains readable by an older consumer, which gets a correct
(if incomplete) view of the path. Version bumps in `PathOpen` signal
structural changes that older readers cannot safely ignore.

### Durability

Writer durability is out of band. The format does not mandate an `fsync`
policy. Implementations typically sit somewhere on this spectrum:

| Policy | Tradeoff |
| ------ | -------- |
| No sync (OS-buffered) | Fastest. Unflushed lines lost on crash. Appropriate for ephemeral traces. |
| `fsync` per line | Strongest durability. Highest overhead. |
| `fsync` per batch / on close | Compromise. Suits agent traces that emit many steps in close succession. |

## Line Kinds

Each line body is a JSON object with the fields below. Fields marked
optional may be omitted.

### `PathOpen`

Exactly once, as the first line. Carries the initial path identity and any
path-level metadata known at open time.

```json
{"PathOpen": {
  "version": "1",
  "id": "pr-42",
  "base": {"uri": "github:org/repo", "ref": "abc123"},
  "graph_ref": "toolpath://archive/release-v2",
  "meta": {
    "title": "Add email validation",
    "source": "github:myorg/myrepo/pull/42",
    "intent": "...",
    "refs": [{"rel": "fixes", "href": "issue://..."}]
  }
}}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| `version` | yes | Format version string. v1 = `"1"`. |
| `id` | yes | `PathIdentity.id`. |
| `base` | no | `PathIdentity.base` — same shape as canonical JSON. |
| `graph_ref` | no | `$ref`-style URL naming a graph this path belongs to. See *Schema Change*. |
| `meta` | no | Initial `PathMeta` excluding `actors` and `signatures` (those have dedicated line kinds). |

### `Step`

Zero or more. The body is the existing `Step` JSON shape verbatim — including
`step.meta`, which may carry step-level signatures, intent, refs, or actor
definitions.

```json
{"Step": {
  "step": {
    "id": "step-003",
    "parents": ["step-002"],
    "actor": "agent:claude-code",
    "timestamp": "2026-04-14T15:30:00Z"
  },
  "change": {
    "src/auth/validator.rs": {"raw": "@@ -1,5 +1,25 @@\n..."}
  },
  "meta": {
    "intent": "Add email validation"
  }
}}
```

### `ActorDef`

Zero or more. Inserts or overwrites an entry in `path.meta.actors`.

```json
{"ActorDef": {
  "actor": "human:alex",
  "definition": {
    "name": "Alex Kesling",
    "identities": [{"system": "github", "id": "akesling"}],
    "keys": [{"type": "gpg", "fingerprint": "ABCD1234..."}]
  }
}}
```

Overwrite (rather than merge) is deliberate: an actor definition is the
complete current record for that actor. A writer that wants to add a key
re-emits the full definition.

### `Signature`

Zero or more. Appends to the signature array at either path or step scope.

```json
{"Signature": {
  "target": "path",
  "signature": {
    "signer": "human:bob",
    "key": "gpg:EFGH5678",
    "scope": "reviewer",
    "sig": "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n...",
    "timestamp": "2026-04-14T16:00:00Z"
  }
}}
```

| `target` | Effect |
| -------- | ------ |
| `"path"` | Append to `path.meta.signatures`. |
| `"step:<step-id>"` | Append to the named step's `meta.signatures`. Referenced `Step` line MUST already have appeared. |

### `PathMeta`

Zero or more. Field-wise merge into `path.meta`. Last-write-wins per field.
Array fields (e.g. `refs`) **replace**; they do not append.

```json
{"PathMeta": {
  "patch": {
    "title": "Revised title",
    "intent": "...",
    "refs": [{"rel": "tracks", "href": "..."}],
    "extra": {"custom-field": "..."}
  }
}}
```

Append-like semantics for `actors` and `signatures` are handled by the
dedicated `ActorDef` and `Signature` line kinds; `PathMeta` does not carry
those fields.

### `Head`

Zero or more. Explicitly names the current head step. Last occurrence wins.

```json
{"Head": {"step_id": "step-005"}}
```

### `PathClose`

Optional terminator. Indicates the writer is done and no more lines will
follow. Readers MAY use this to distinguish a completed file from one still
being appended to. Readers MUST tolerate its absence.

```json
{"PathClose": {}}
```

## Reading JSONL

How a reader produces a canonical `{"Path": {...}}` document from a
`.path.jsonl` file.

```
state:
  path_id, base, graph_ref     ← from PathOpen
  path_meta                    ← PathOpen.meta or empty; actors={}, signatures=[]
  steps = []                   (in arrival order)
  step_index = {}              (step.id → &steps[i])
  head = null                  (last Head line's step_id, if any)

for each line after PathOpen, in order:
  Step:
    append to steps; record in step_index
  ActorDef { actor, definition }:
    path_meta.actors[actor] = definition
  Signature { target: "path", signature }:
    path_meta.signatures.append(signature)
  Signature { target: "step:<id>", signature }:
    require step_index[id] exists (else fatal error)
    step_index[id].meta.signatures.append(signature)
  PathMeta { patch }:
    for each field in patch:
      path_meta[field] = patch[field]     # arrays replace
  Head { step_id }:
    head = step_id
  PathClose:
    end-of-stream sentinel; no state change

on EOF:
  if head is null:
    candidates = { s in steps : no other s' in steps has s.id in s'.parents }
    if |candidates| != 1: fatal error ("ambiguous or missing head")
    head = the one candidate's id
  emit: {"Path": {
    "path": {
      "id": path_id,
      "base": base,
      "graph_ref": graph_ref,
      "head": head
    },
    "steps": steps,
    "meta": path_meta
  }}
```

The single-tip DAG rule applies only when `head` is unspecified. Paths with
intentional dead ends SHOULD emit an explicit `Head` line.

## Writing JSONL

How a writer produces a `.path.jsonl` file from a canonical `Path`.
Used for converting stored documents and for round-trip testing.

```
emit PathOpen {
  version: "1",
  id: path.id,
  base: path.base,
  graph_ref: path.graph_ref,
  meta: {                        # path.meta minus actors, signatures
    title, source, intent, refs, extra
  }
}

for actor_key in sorted(path.meta.actors.keys()):
  emit ActorDef { actor: actor_key, definition: path.meta.actors[actor_key] }

for step in path.steps:           # original array order
  emit Step { ...step... }
  for sig in step.meta.signatures:  # original order
    emit Signature { target: "step:" + step.id, signature: sig }

for sig in path.meta.signatures:  # original order
  emit Signature { target: "path", signature: sig }

emit Head { step_id: path.head }
emit PathClose {}
```

## Round-Trip Guarantees

Reading JSONL is a lossy operation: `PathMeta` last-write-wins semantics
collapse intermediate metadata states, and line ordering is not preserved.
This means JSONL → JSON → JSONL does not reproduce the original line
sequence. However, the canonical JSON form is stable:

- **JSON → JSONL → JSON:** `read(write(P)) == P` for any canonical
  `Path` `P`. Writing emits every field, and reading reconstructs the
  original document.
- **JSONL → JSON → JSONL → JSON:** `read(write(read(L))) == read(L)`
  for any valid JSONL stream `L`. Reading collapses metadata and
  resolves head; converting back and reading again produces the same
  canonical document.

The format does **not** guarantee:

- **JSONL round-trip:** `write(read(L))` may differ from `L` in line
  count, line ordering, and metadata line content (intermediate
  `PathMeta` and `ActorDef` overwrites are collapsed when read).
- **Canonical JSONL:** Two different JSONL files may read to the same
  JSON document. There is no unique JSONL representation.

Every canonical JSON field has a corresponding line kind:

| Canonical field | Line kind |
| --------------- | --------- |
| `path.id`, `path.base`, `path.graph_ref` | `PathOpen` |
| `path.head` | `Head` (or inferred) |
| `path.meta.title` / `source` / `intent` / `refs` / `extra` | `PathOpen.meta` or `PathMeta` |
| `path.meta.actors` entries | `ActorDef` |
| `path.meta.signatures` entries | `Signature` with `target: "path"` |
| `steps[*]` (entire step including inner `meta`) | `Step` |
| `steps[*].meta.signatures` entries | `Signature` with `target: "step:<id>"` |

## Signatures

Canonicalization is unchanged. Signatures are computed over the canonical
JSON form per JCS (RFC 8785), as defined in the base RFC. Because
`read(write(read(L))) == read(L)`, a signature computed on a canonical
JSON document remains valid after any number of JSON → JSONL → JSON
conversion cycles.

Late-arriving signatures — for example, a reviewer approval added after
the steps are recorded — arrive as `Signature` lines appended to the file.
The signed payload is still the canonical JSON form: the reviewer reads
the current JSONL file into canonical JSON, computes the signature per
the base RFC, and emits a `Signature` line.

## Schema Change

One additive change to the canonical schema, in `crates/toolpath/src/types.rs`:

```rust
pub struct PathIdentity {
    pub id: String,
    pub base: Option<Base>,
    pub head: String,
    pub graph_ref: Option<String>,   // NEW
}
```

Backwards compatible: `graph_ref` is optional and omitted when empty.
Existing documents and signatures validate unchanged. This field lets a
path name the graph it belongs to, supporting cross-referencing from
streaming contexts where the containing graph is known up front.

The value of `graph_ref` uses the same `$ref`-style URL conventions as
`Graph.paths[*].$ref`:

- `https://...`, `s3://...`, `file:///...` — external references
- `toolpath://<archive-name>/<graph-id>` — named archive references

## Example

A minimal streaming session recording a two-step path:

```
{"PathOpen":{"version":"1","id":"pr-42","base":{"uri":"github:org/repo","ref":"abc123"},"meta":{"title":"Add email validation"}}}
{"ActorDef":{"actor":"agent:claude-code","definition":{"name":"Claude Code","provider":"anthropic"}}}
{"Step":{"step":{"id":"step-001","actor":"agent:claude-code","timestamp":"2026-04-14T10:00:00Z"},"change":{"src/validator.rs":{"raw":"@@ -0,0 +1,20 @@\n+pub struct Validator..."}},"meta":{"intent":"Add email validation struct"}}}
{"Step":{"step":{"id":"step-002","parents":["step-001"],"actor":"tool:rustfmt","timestamp":"2026-04-14T10:00:05Z"},"change":{"src/validator.rs":{"raw":"@@ -3,3 +3,3 @@\n..."}},"meta":{"intent":"Auto-format"}}}
{"Head":{"step_id":"step-002"}}
{"Signature":{"target":"path","signature":{"signer":"human:alex","key":"gpg:ABCD1234","scope":"author","sig":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n..."}}}
{"PathClose":{}}
```

Reading this JSONL file produces a canonical `{"Path": {...}}` document with:

- `path.id = "pr-42"`, `path.base = {...}`, `path.head = "step-002"`
- `steps = [step-001, step-002]`
- `path.meta.title = "Add email validation"`
- `path.meta.actors = {"agent:claude-code": {...}}`
- `path.meta.signatures = [<author signature>]`

Writing that canonical document back to JSONL produces an equivalent
line sequence (modulo the normalized write ordering).

## Design Rationale

### Why atomic steps instead of open/patch/close?

An earlier sketch considered a `StepOpen` / `StepPatch` / `StepClose`
lifecycle so that a single step could stream in pieces — for example, the
intent becomes known at t=0, the diff at t=20s. This was rejected for v1:

- Atomic steps preserve append-only semantics — no line is ever
  conditional on a later line's arrival.
- Live agent traces can emit a step as soon as the agent
  knows both the artifact and the change. The "progress before diff is
  ready" case is addressed by emitting a coarser step on arrival and a
  finer step once the diff stabilizes, or by emitting progress updates
  outside the toolpath file entirely.

The mechanism can be added in a future revision via new line kinds,
guarded by a version bump.

### Why skip unknown variants instead of rejecting them?

An earlier draft treated unknown variants as fatal errors, reasoning that
silently skipping a line means silently losing provenance. This was
reversed because:

- Forward compatibility matters more in practice. A file written by a
  newer producer should be readable by an older consumer — the older
  reader gets a correct (if incomplete) view of the path rather than
  refusing to read the file at all.
- Provenance is not lost — the unknown lines are still in the file.
  A reader that understands them will interpret them correctly. An
  older reader that skips them produces the same result it would have
  produced before the new line kind existed.
- Version bumps in `PathOpen` remain available for structural changes
  that older readers truly cannot handle (e.g., changes to `Step`
  semantics or ordering constraints).

### Why one path per file?

A single file could in principle carry an entire graph — `GraphOpen`,
then interleaved `PathOpen` / `Step` / `PathClose` blocks scoped by a
`path` field on every line. That design was rejected because:

- The primary use case (live agent trace) has one writer per path.
  Multiplexing multiple paths into one file adds coordination
  complexity that the use case doesn't need.
- Graphs already have a composition mechanism (`$ref`). A graph that
  references streaming path files is simpler than a graph-scoped stream
  and composes with the existing model.
- Per-line path scoping makes every line heavier and makes "tail this
  path" harder.

### Why `graph_ref` on `PathIdentity` rather than only in `PathOpen`?

A streaming writer that knows its containing graph up front (a release
automation pipeline recording PRs) benefits from stamping `graph_ref` on
open. But round-trip requires the sealed JSON to carry the same
information, which means the canonical `PathIdentity` must have a place
to store it. Adding the field to `PathIdentity` is a small additive
change and keeps the JSONL format a pure serialization of the canonical
model.

### Why `PathMeta.patch` arrays replace instead of append?

Last-write-wins per field is simple and symmetric. Append semantics for
arrays creates asymmetry (`refs` appends but scalars replace), and the
fields most likely to "grow over time" — `actors`, `signatures` — already
have dedicated line kinds with the right semantics. Writers that want to
add a ref without disturbing existing refs emit a `PathMeta` line with the
complete new array.

## Compatibility

- **Canonical JSON readers** are unaffected. The JSONL format is a peer,
  not a replacement.
- **Existing canonical documents** remain valid. The only schema change —
  `graph_ref` on `PathIdentity` — is additive and optional.
- **Existing signatures** remain valid. Canonicalization is unchanged.
- **Tooling** that operates on canonical JSON (validate, render, query)
  can accept `.path.jsonl` input by reading it into canonical form
  before operating.

## Open Questions

### Should writers canonicalize line bodies with JCS?

A stronger "normalized write" guarantee would canonicalize each line
body per JCS, so that writing a given `Path` produces byte-identical
JSONL across implementations. This would allow signing a JSONL file
directly rather than signing the canonical JSON. Current answer: not in
v1. The canonical signing path (read → JCS → sign) is sufficient and
avoids introducing a second canonicalization rule.

### Should readers warn or error on a truncated file?

A file missing `PathClose` and ending mid-line (the last line is not
newline-terminated) is ambiguous: still being written, or crashed
mid-write? Current answer: readers treat an unterminated final line as a
fatal error and treat EOF-without-`PathClose` as informational. Readers
tailing a live file use heuristics (file still open, recent mtime) to
distinguish the cases.

### Should there be a `StepRef` line for late step-level metadata?

A writer might learn, after emitting a step, that the step's `meta.intent`
should change or that a new ref should be attached. v1 has no mechanism
for this — a step is immutable once emitted. A future `StepPatch` line
could cover the case, guarded by a version bump.

## Prior Art

- **JSON Lines** (jsonlines.org): Line-oriented JSON for log files.
  Direct inspiration for the container format.
- **NDJSON**: Same idea, different name. Widely used in data pipelines.
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Line-oriented event streams over HTTP.
  The `event:` / `data:` framing influenced the variant-per-line
  approach.
- **Git pack protocol**: Variant-tagged messages over a stream. Similar
  structural pattern at a lower level of abstraction.
- **OpenTelemetry OTLP**: Structured append-only telemetry streams.
  Shares the "each record is self-describing" property.
- **JCS (RFC 8785)**: JSON Canonicalization Scheme. Used unchanged for
  the signature path.


`PathOpen.base` preserves the same optional `from` structural reference as JSON
documents, independently of VCS context. A stored continuation stream contains
only owned steps; it does not resend inherited steps as local replacements.
Resolving and composing a frozen base follows the core RFC, not append replay.
